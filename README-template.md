### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I made this using flexbox! I started section by section putting the different text inside of the wrappers they needed to be in. I then switched my flex-box into a column to make everything line up vertically and then put the proper CSS to make everything look as close as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### Continued development

This project was a really good project coming back to CSS after taking a few days off to learn some JavaScript. I was afraid that I wouldn't remember everything but things seemed to flow pretty naturally so I beleive I am getting a pretty clear understanding of how most of CSS works and how to use Flex-box! In the future I will continue to improve on CSS skills and begin to add in some javascript here pretty soon!
